    <h1>Discover and collect minimal effort NFTs</h1>
    <p>
      RASCII is the world's largest and <strong>only</strong> marketplace for
      NFTs that you can say you own.
    </p>

    <section class="side text-center">
      <div>
        <h2>Collect the ones you like</h2>
        <p>
          All of our computer-made NFTs are curated to look and feel unqiue
          while being easily disguisable as one-another.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Copy the ones you like</h2>
        <p>
          Once you've found an NFT you like, feel free to pretend you own
          it&mdash;as long as you don't say you do, you don't.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our <abbr title="Non Fucking Tolerable">NFT</abbr>s</h2>
      <p>
        We offer computer-generated ASCII art that is compressed and serialised
        into a some-what random looking token that you can portray as owned by
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike any other NFT, you actually have the data, no hyper-link
        required! Now that's pretty damn cool&mdash;though you can only view it
        on this site.

      The <i>only</i> <abbr title="Nice Fungible Text">NFT</abbr> marketplace!
    </summary>
    <p>
      We offer a new wave of NFTs to the ever-growing metaverse! Every item
      you see on this page is a unique, randomly generated string called
      <i>Nice, Fungible Text</i> (or NFT for short).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><dfn title="Nice, Fungible Text">Nice, Fungible Text</dfn></i> is a
      new kind of text that can be generated, stored, and shared across the
      web! It's a new way to express yourself that is accessible to everyone.
      Just copy the token and it's yours!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our prices are competetive, affordable, and fair. If you are not 100%
      satisfied with your NFT, you can remove the link from your
      browser history <i>anytime</i> for a <b>full</b> refund. No gass fees or
      private keys, just a <i>simple click</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's simple and easy to get started with <i>Nice, Fungible Text</i> so
      try one for yourself today!
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary>
      We provide the <b>largest</b> and <b>only</b> NFTs that you can truly
      own.
    </summary>
    <p>
      Since our NFTs aren't just links to some resource&mdash;you get
      security in knowing that you still have ownership of your NFT even if
      we were to no longer exist.
