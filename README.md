Let's poke a bit of fun at NFTs &mdash; shall we?

## Building

You will need to have https://deno.land installed, you can find instructions for
how to do this on their website. Now we can bundle the code using the config
found in `deno.jsonc`:

```shell
$ deno task bundle
$ # or
$ deno task bundle:watch
```

It's also good to format code that you write using:

```shell
$ deno fmt
```
